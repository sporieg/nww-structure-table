# LANCER Alternative Structure

This module implements [NWW's Alternative Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ukwZ1fJe2zktINrwWHbIH0WiTeyqyye0NdlsyFa7IVk/edit?tab=t.0t) rules for Lancer. 

This is a straight replacement for the structure rolling code in the basic system, and should work without the need for additional configuration.

Those rules are used with permission.

Code from the LANCER system by Eranziel is used uder GPL3.0
